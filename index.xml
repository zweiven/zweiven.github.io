      <description>Prospective Graduate Students I am currently recruiting both MS and PhD students to work with me (and others in ENVS!) on research that integrates environmental economics, computer science, and a range of natural sciences.
I encourage students from all backgrounds to apply, and especially students whose backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are underrepresented in the fields I work in.
Check out the people page to learn more about the students I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with so far.</description>

      <description>I am broadly interested in three topics:
 How do environmental shocks (e.g. heat waves, regime shifts) influence economic activity, and how do policies, mitigation, and adaptation moderate those effects? How can machine learning and econometrics/applied statistics be combined to better answer environmental questions? How can tools commonly applied in economics (e.g., program evaluation, dynamic optimization) help improve conservation outcomes?  Publications (Chances are Google Scholar is more up to date)</description>
