      <description>Current Students  Ian Luby PhD @ UMN
Co-advisor: Steve Polasky
I am a natural resource economist answering questions at the nexus of policy, science, and economics. Within that space my research has two main areas of emphasis:
1) I use economic and scientific models to analyze and improve conservation policy and planning. I have projects that examine policy at every scale from planning a global strategy for forest conservation to improving targeting of local easements.</description>

      <description>I am broadly interested in three topics:
 How do environmental shocks (e.g. heat waves, regime shifts) influence economic activity, and how do policies, mitigation, and adaptation moderate those effects? What do environmental policies impact innovation (both product and process) that can improve environmental outcomes? How can machine learning and econometrics/applied statistics be combined to better answer research questions?  Example projects are below, ranging from ongoing to completed.
